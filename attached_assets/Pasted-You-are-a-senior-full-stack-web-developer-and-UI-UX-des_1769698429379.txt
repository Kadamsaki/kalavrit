You are a senior full-stack web developer and UI/UX designer.

I want you to design and develop a premium, emotionally driven art website for a single independent artist (this is NOT a multi-artist marketplace).

Startup idea context:
This website is for an artist who creates handmade paintings and already has real customer reactions where people feel happy and emotionally connected after seeing the artwork.
Customers should be able to buy ready-made paintings as well as place fully customized painting orders such as family portraits, couple paintings, friends, pets, and memory-based art.
The website should sell emotions and memories, not mass products.

Website type:
Single Artist Personal Art Brand Website
It should feel like a modern art studio and premium gallery, not an Amazon-style marketplace.

Required modules to be properly designed and developed:

Home Page
The home page should have an emotional hero section with a powerful headline and subtext.
There should be a clear call-to-action button like “Get Your Custom Painting”.
Include featured artworks, customer reactions/testimonials, and smooth scrolling sections.
Use subtle animations to make the page feel alive and premium.

Artwork Gallery / Shop
Display high-quality images of ready-made paintings in a clean grid layout.
Each artwork should open into a detailed page showing the painting story, size, medium, price, and a buy now option.
Include filters such as painting type and price range.
Add elegant hover effects and transitions on artwork cards.

Custom Order Module (core feature)
Create a detailed and clean custom painting order experience.
The form should allow customers to select the painting type, upload reference images, write an emotional description or story, choose size, budget range, and expected delivery timeline.
A multi-step form experience is preferred for better UX.
After submission, show a confirmation screen that builds trust.

Payment Integration
Integrate payment options like UPI and cards (Razorpay ready).
Allow full payment or advance payment.
Show a clean order confirmation and success screen.

Reviews and Reactions Section
Include star ratings, written customer reviews, and before-after reaction images or videos.
This section should highlight emotions and happiness, not just ratings.

About the Artist Page
Tell the artist’s personal story, journey, and philosophy behind the art.
Use real photos, process shots, and storytelling-based content.

Contact and Trust Section
Include a contact form, WhatsApp integration, and an FAQ section covering delivery time, revisions, and refund policy.

Admin Panel
A simple admin panel is required to add and edit artworks, manage custom orders, update order status, and feature selected artworks on the homepage.

UI and UX requirements (very important):
The overall look should be premium, artistic, emotional, and clean.
Avoid loud colors and cluttered layouts.
Use smooth micro-interactions, scroll-based animations, and modern transitions.
The website should be fully responsive and mobile-first.

Color theme:
Use a warm off-white or ivory background.
Primary accent color should be terracotta or soft brown.
Secondary accent should be muted gold.
Text color should be deep charcoal black.
CTA buttons should stand out while still looking elegant.

Typography:
Use Playfair Display or Cinzel for headings.
Use Poppins or Lato for body text.
Maintain proper spacing, readability, and hierarchy.

Tech stack preference:
Frontend using React or Next.js
Styling with Tailwind CSS
Animations using Framer Motion
Backend with Node.js and Express
Database using MongoDB
Image storage via Cloudinary
Payments via Razorpay

Animation guidelines:
Hero section text reveal animations
Hover effects on artwork cards
Smooth page transitions
Subtle button hover micro-animations
Avoid over-animation; keep everything classy and smooth.

Final expectation:
The final website should be production-ready, visually stunning, and emotionally engaging.
It should make visitors feel connected to the art and confident about ordering customized paintings.
Think of it as a blend of a premium art gallery and a modern creative startup website.
