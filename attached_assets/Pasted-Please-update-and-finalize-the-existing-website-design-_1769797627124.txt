Please update and finalize the existing website design and development using the following detailed instructions.
Do NOT change the previously defined color theme, typography, UI style, animations, or overall visual language.

Brand Identity

Brand Name: KalaVrit

Brand Tagline: Turning emotions into art

Replace all artist-name references with KalaVrit.

Ensure logo text, header, footer, and metadata consistently use KalaVrit.

1. Home Page Content Update

Update the homepage headline and content to reflect multiple art styles instead of a single artist.

Messaging should clearly communicate that KalaVrit offers multiple art forms such as Ghibli, vector art, sketches, charcoal, and realistic art.

Maintain an emotional tone focused on memories, feelings, and personalization.

The tagline “Turning emotions into art” should be visible on the hero section.

Keep smooth animations and premium layout exactly as previously defined.

2. Artwork Gallery / Custom Order Page Updates
Painting Type Dropdown

Replace the existing painting type section with a dropdown menu.

Dropdown options must be exactly:

Ghibli

Vector Art

Sketch

Charcoal

Realistic

Person Selection Dropdown

Add a second dropdown directly below painting type.

Label it “Person”.

Options:

Couple

Solo

Size & Frame Options

Keep the size selection dropdown.

Remove the budget dropdown completely.

Add a new dropdown or toggle for:

With Frame

Without Frame

3. Submit Request → WhatsApp Auto-Message Integration

Remove the payment module entirely.

On clicking “Submit Request”, automatically redirect the user to WhatsApp with a pre-filled message.

Use WhatsApp API / wa.me integration.

WhatsApp Auto-Message Format

The message should be auto-generated using the form data in this exact structured format:

Hello KalaVrit 👋
I would like to place a custom art request.

🎨 Art Style: {Selected Painting Type}
👤 Person: {Couple / Solo}
📏 Size: {Selected Size}
🖼️ Frame: {With Frame / Without Frame}

📝 Description / Emotion:
{Customer’s written description}

📎 Reference Images:
{Image upload indicator or attachment}

Please let me know the next steps.
Thank you!

Ensure all selected fields auto-fill correctly and the WhatsApp chat opens smoothly without extra user effort.

4. Reactions Page – Customer Submission Feature

Keep the existing reaction display layout.

Add a “Share Your Reaction” section for customers.

Create a submission form with the following fields:

Customer name

Star rating

Short reaction / feedback text

Upload option for photo or video

Submitted reactions should go for admin approval before appearing publicly.

Maintain emotional and clean UI styling consistent with the website.

5. About Page Update

Change the page title from “About the Artist” to About KalaVrit.

Rewrite content to explain:

What KalaVrit stands for

Its vision

The idea of turning emotions and memories into meaningful art

Avoid focusing on an individual artist story.

6. Design & Style Constraints (Important)

Do NOT modify:

Color palette

Fonts

Spacing system

Animations

UI layout philosophy

All newly added sections must visually blend with the existing premium, artistic, and emotional design.

Final Goal

Deliver a refined, emotionally engaging, and highly interactive art website for KalaVrit that reflects multiple art styles, personalized experiences, and seamless WhatsApp-based communication.
The website should feel like a modern digital art studio where emotions are transformed into art.
